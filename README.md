# CI102
Coursework from CI 102 (Computing and Informatics Design II), Winter 2019, Drexel University<br />
The purpose of this class was to work in groups of 3-5 students to create a project related to computer science, such as a website, a game, an app, etc.
My group consisted of four people: myself, Harrison Beerley, Andrew Shoffler, and Michael Wyda.
We chose to design a website that would allow students in the Philadelphia area to interact and to buy and sell unwanted furniture and textbooks.
Most of the course was spent planning the project by making abstracts and requirements documentation.
The final project of this course was to make a prototype of our website. <br />
<br />
To view the preliminary site we made, please download the unite folder. In a command line (instructions for Window's command prompt), 
go into the prototype folder inside the unite folder. Type the following: python manage.py runserver <br />
Copy and paste the url given into a web browser to view the prototype website. <br />
Alternatively, you may also view this <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fGTa7eXABzLIhVRP_MiO0N6NtwHj_ANcqGbIsWIQ2v8/edit#slide=id.g529b90106d_0_0">google slides presentation</a> that includes a video of the functions of the prototype website. <br />
<br />
For this class, I was the project manager. My job was to make sure group members coordinated with and communicated with one another. I also had the job of defining deadlines and making sure everyone met them. For the prototype website, the group worked together to learn the basics of Django, the framework we used. I, along with another student, were the primary people in charge of putting the entire prototype website together while the other two students researched how we could put our future website on a live server and how to utilize a database for our needs.
